#### Option 3: Custom Property Testing
**Pros**: No external dependencies, tailored to our needs
**Cons**: Significant development effort, likely inferior to established tools

### Decision
**Chosen**: Use hypothesis for mathematical functions

### Rationale
- Mathematical functions benefit greatly from property-based testing
- hypothesis is mature and well-integrated with pytest
- Likely to find edge cases we wouldn't think to test manually
- Educational value for the team

### Consequences
- **Positive**: More thorough testing, automatic edge case discovery
- **Negative**: Additional dependency, slower test execution, learning curve
- **Neutral**: Need to identify appropriate properties to test

## ADR-004: Test Organization Structure

**Date**: 2024-10-11  
**Status**: Decided  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

### Context
We need to organize tests in a way that's scalable and maintainable as the project grows.

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Flat Structure
```
tests/
├── test_sum_five.py
├── test_multiply_six.py
└── test_cli.py
```
**Pros**: Simple, easy to find tests
**Cons**: Doesn't scale, no logical grouping

#### Option 2: By Test Type
```
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
└── property/
```
**Pros**: Clear separation of test types, scalable
**Cons**: May duplicate similar tests across directories

#### Option 3: By Module
```
tests/
├── test_mathematical_operations/
├── test_cli/
└── test_parsing/
```
**Pros**: Mirrors source structure, easy to find related tests
**Cons**: Harder to run specific test types

### Decision
**Chosen**: Hybrid approach - by test type with module subdivision

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_mathematical_operations.py
│   └── test_input_parsing.py
├── integration/
│   └── test_cli_interface.py
└── property/
    └── test_mathematical_properties.py
```

### Rationale
- Provides clear separation of test types for different execution contexts
- Allows running specific test types (e.g., only unit tests for fast feedback)
- Scales well as project grows
- Makes it clear what type of test to write for new functionality

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear organization, scalable, supports different test execution strategies
- **Negative**: Slightly more complex structure, need to decide where edge cases belong
- **Neutral**: Need to establish conventions for test placement
